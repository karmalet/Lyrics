15 ContributorsCongratulations  (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Jae]
I don't even know how I can talk to you now
It's not you, the you who talks to me anymore
And sure I know that sometimes it gets hard
But even with all my love, what we had
You just gave it up

[Pre-Chorus: Sungjin]
Thought we were meant to be
I thought that you belonged to me
I'll play the fool instead
Oh but then I know that this is the end
Oh, oh

[Chorus: Young K, Sungjin, Wonpil]
Congratulations, glad you're doing great, woah
Congratulations, how are you okay, woah
How could you be so fine
I can see it in your eyes
The same look that you gave me
That kills me inside, oh
I don't even need to ask, yeah
I know you too damn well, yeah
I can see that smile and can tell
That you did more than move on
I hate that you're happy
I hope that you can't sleep
Just knowing that I could be with somebody new
That I'd be just like you

So hey, there's a couple of things I should
Say to you, I promise I'd be good if I could
But yeah, I'm sorry I'm not sorry
I can't be happy for you now
And hey, that's great
Must be nice to not feel anything
Cause I'm feeling just the same way, okay
I don't give a, ahhhhh

[Chorus: Young K, Sungjin, Wonpil]
Congratulations, glad you're doing great, woah
Congratulations, how are you okay, woah
How could you be so fine
I can see it in your eyes
The same look that you gave me
That kills me inside, oh
I don't even need to ask, yeah
I know you too damn well, yeah
I can see that smile and can tell
That you did more than move on
I hate that you're happy
I hope that you can't sleep
Just knowing that I could be with somebody new
That I'd be just like you
[Bridge: Young K]
Yeah, really wow girl congratulations
You couldn't wait two months, so impatient
Your SNS page is now full of smiley faces
But I'm singing this with DAY6, so I give you my best wishes
Cause I am over you, we're overdue
No problem saying "How do you do"
Oh I've been good
My Days have been so good to me, thankfully
Oh, you used to be a muse to me
My best memory, truthfully
But that's about it
THE END

[Chorus: Wonpil, Jae, Sungjin]
Congratulations, so you win again, woah
Congratulations, you just took away, woah
Our memories so far
They're gone, just like you are
Now, all I have is me, and it's getting too hard
I saw it on your face, yeah
I knew you too damn well, yeah
I heard you laugh and knew
That you did more than move on
I hate that you're happy
I hate that I can't sleep
Keep thinking about
How he now seems better off, too
Just like I was with you4Embed
