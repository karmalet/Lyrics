5 ContributorsLove Don’t Hurt (English Version) LyricsI know that you've been broken
It's easy to see, easy to see
Let me keep you in the moment
Baby, just give it to me
I see the way you acting up in your mind
Wondering if I'm worth the ride
It's a natural reaction
But we gon' be takin' our time
If you don't try
Then you ain't gonna ever know
If you don't try, baby
If it takes all night, let's do it
I just wanna show you the way
I'm gonna love ya
Like you never been loved
Never, never been loved before
And I'm gonna give ya
All of, all of my heart
Baby, you the one I adore
I see the way that you been feeling
And I know exactly what you needing
I'm gonna love ya
'Till love don't hurt anymore
You’ve been trying to dry those tears so long
Maybe in time, you’ll be alright
Staring in my eyes, baby
You can’t deny what you keep inside
We might be the perfect score
So here, I’m waiting at your shores
Oh baby, please open up your doors
It’s you that I’m fighting for
If you don't try
Then you ain't gonna ever know
If you don't try, baby
If it takes all night, let's do it
I just wanna show you the way
I'm gonna love ya
Like you never been loved
Never, never been loved before
And I'm gonna give ya
All of, all of my heart
Baby, you the one I adore
I see the way that you been feeling
And I know exactly what you needing
I'm gonna love ya
'Till love don't hurt anymore
Heartbreak won't break what we got
It's all in the feeling
I'm gonna be showing you good love
This ain't nothing
Like all those other ones
I'm gonna, I'm gonna love ya
Like you never been loved
Never, never been loved before
And I'm gonna give ya
All of, all of my heart
Baby, you the one I adore
