4 ContributorsVineyard (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
When she was a little girl
You'll never want to know
The places she liked
The things she enjoyed

[Verse 2]
Never ask the girl what she liked
About her childhood
Youâ€™ll never know
What she's trying to hide from you so

[Verse 3]
Don't ask
Don't think
Don't guess
Don't say anything that could hurt her
Don't raise your voice
Don't say goodbye
Here, here

[Chorus]
Never let her go
Never let her go
Never let her go
'Cause she will never be fine alone
Never ever let her walk alone
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Never ever, never ever

Never let her go
Never let her go
Never let her go
'Cause she will always always be yours, yeah
Always yours
Never ever, never ever1Embed
