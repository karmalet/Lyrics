8 ContributorsWEDDING DRESS (English version) Lyrics[Intro]
Some say it ain't over till it's over
But I guess it's really over now
There's something I gotta say before I let you go
Listen...

[Verse 1]
Can't believe what's goin' on
Gotta keep my cool, be calm
When I heard you and he was screamin' out of control
All I can think about is "No, no, no... he won't
Hurt the one I've cared for so long, long... Hell, no."
I know we're done, and now it's none of my concern but how
Can two be windin' out from only weeks in goin' out
Just makes me feel that what we had was real
Could it be or is it too late? (Oh, oh baby)

[Chorus]
Baby!
Listen to your heart, won't let you down
Cause you should be my Lady!
Now that we're apart love will show how
Life carries on...
I've never felt so strong
Life can lead us to a happiness never ending
If we just know that we belong to each other
Never worry, grow as we go
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
See you in your wedding dress
I can see you in your wedding dress
I see you walking down in your ... (wedding dress)
I can see you in your wedding dress (Oh, yea~)

[Verse 2]
I was never perfect no
But I'd never let it go to a point I'm ragin', throwin' making you uncomfortable
What he didn't, did to you was unacceptable
You claimed everything was okay. That's impossible
Just know I'm here for you
All clear for you from night to sun
God, I've been near to you, the feel of you gives me a rush
It makes me feel that what we have is real
It could never be too late oh yeah yeah

[Chorus]
Baby!
Listen to your heart, won't let you down
Cause you should be my Lady!
Now that we're apart love will show how
Life carries on...
I've never felt so strong
Life can lead us to a happiness never ending
If we just know that we belong to each other
Never worry, grow as we go
[Post-Chorus]
See you in your wedding dress
I can see you in your wedding dress
I see you walking down in your ... (wedding dress)
I can see you in your wedding dress (Oh, yea~)

[Bridge]
Baby girl you won't regret
Come along just take my hand
Let's start this journey livin' life so beautiful
This happy hope that we spread, love and see
It goes deeper so deep from my heart (Whoa oh oh oh oh)

[Chorus]
I've never felt so strong
Life can lead us to a happiness never ending
If we just know that we belong to each other
Never worry, grow as we go
See you in your wedding dress
I can see you in your wedding dress
Never let go... never let go
Oh yeah2Embed
