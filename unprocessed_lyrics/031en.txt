3 ContributorsVALENTI (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
I can feel it truly in my heart
Catchin' my heart, you're my destiny
Nothing gonna stop my love for you
So reaching your hand, hold on to me
Shakin' my heart, you're my dreamy boy
You're the heat, my fireworks
Baby kiss me softly I need you
Oh, step in, step in babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna know how we met each other?
How did we get the feelings we have?
Boy, I fall in love with you
Remember the moment

[Chorus]
Born to love you
Want to take you into paradise
Just fighting for love, never stop my body
Take your hand, then steal your hеart and you'll be in my arms
Keep your smile and I nevеr let go
You are my dream

[Verse 2]
Tell me, tell me what I mean to you
Let me keep you warm and dry
Do you, do you miss me day and night?
Ain't nothing gonna harm you
Makin', makin' our love happy end
Don't be shy, don't be so down
Baby let me show you how I feel
Oh, step in, step in babe
