8 ContributorsLATATA (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Soyeon, Soojin]
Ay, yo, you know what? I'm waiting for ya, I only want ya
They say I'm loca, but hey, whatever, I only want ya
Running the red light, move it now left-right, we going all night
I'll take you higher, set it on fire, you're my desire

[Pre-Chorus: Minnie, Yuqi]
Uh-oh, what do you got to lose, keep it going, baby
Falling down, you and I, we can get caught up in the moment, you like that?
Go, go, burn until there's nothing left
'Cause I don't care about tomorrow, no, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus: Miyeon, Shuhua]
I love ya!
There ain't nothing I won't do for you, fall with me, lata
I love ya!
Dance the night away with me, let me sing for you, lata
I love ya!
Latata latata latata latata
Latata latata latata latata
Sing for me until you're burnt in my memory, lata
I love ya!

[Refrain: Soyeon, Soojin]
I love ya!
Every day, every night, latata
I love ya!
Every day, every night, latata

Don't be lazy, come over baby
I'm only getting started, time is of the essence (hey hey)
I'll open up, you can go a little deeper, drink it up
And you can keep going 'til you're dizzy (dizzy)
Tear it up, tear it up, sing it latata (tata)
They don't know what to say, going dot dot dot (dot dot)
Ready or not, we making it hot
The jealousy feels good to me, mwah-mwah-mwah

[Pre-Chorus: Minnie, Yuqi]
Uh-oh, how far do you wanna go with me?
Keep on movin' 'til the sunrise, yeah, we can get crazy, you like that?
Go, go, burn until there's nothing left
'Cause I don't care about tomorrow, no, whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
