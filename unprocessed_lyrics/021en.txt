15 ContributorsHELICOPTER (English Version) Lyrics[Chorus: All, Yujin]
I go up, helicopter
Then I make hella noise for the take off
I go up, helicopter
Never give up (Ooh)
Like a pilot

[Verse 1: Yeeun]
See me all-all day, yeah, watch me paint-paint-paint
Pull all this color from the wonders of my bra-bra-brain
I keep my eye on the prize, yeah, keeping my eye on the sky, ay
Honey, wherever I go, I'm watching the door
'Cause I got goals, looking for more, I want it all

[Verse 2: Elkie, Eunbin]
I'm in the zone, I'm in the zone
I'm free up here
I want it more, I want it more
You 'bout to see mе
Fly in the sky for a chance at the gold
Nobody's еver been
Now let me show you a shining road

[Pre-Chorus: Seungyeon, Yujin, Eunbin, Seunghee]
I'm spinning now, and I can finally see those hidden places
I know that we'll make it to the top, just following our heart
We just gotta have a little patience, yeah
Feeling so good, feeling so good, yeah
Shining so bright, shining so bright, star in the night, yeah
We won't be lonely at the top, 'cause the journey don't stop
No matter what we're taking it higher

[Verse 3: Yujin, Eunbin, Seunghee]
Go outta control, outta control
That's what I want
Go outta control, outta control
That's what I want
Above all these clouds, we all the way out
A brand new generation and no, we ain't afraid

[Verse 4: Yeeun]
I go up in the sky, all I need are my ride-or-dies
We roll, never stop, on our way to the top
Looking down on all of these lights
I had all these doubts, but I went and kicked 'em out
And I made lemonade out of these lemons in my mouth, um-um-um
[Pre-Chorus: Seungyeon, Yujin, Eunbin, Seunghee, *Sorn*]
I'll figure out, 'cause all my idols made it look so easy
And if they made it all that far, then I can be a star
And I'll shine for everyone who's with me here
Feeling so cool, feeling so cool, yeah
Breaking the rules, breaking the rules, breaking the rules, yeah
We won't be lonely at the top, 'cause the journey don't stop
No matter what we're taking it higher *(Ooh, whoa!)*
