7 ContributorsBewitched (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Dia, Lola]
Feeling that strange energy
Everytime you look at me
I get you're different, different
So sweet and dangerous
You told me you're gonna
Show me the way to moonlight, whoa
I wanna know, the night is long (Yuh)

[Pre-Chorus: Ella, Sua, Lola, Dia]
As I close my eyes
With your hands that I'm holding (Ah, ya-ya-ya)
Feeling alright
On the clouds, we are walking (Ooh, whoa-oh-oh-oh)
I just keep falling
Take me far away from here
In that moment when I'm
Looking away and all eaten up
Swallowed

[Chorus: Dia, Dajeong]
Bewitched
In your hunger, in your hunger
Bewitched
Spreading faster, spreading fastеr (Ah)
There's not another еxplanation
I keep focus on you
I keep my focus on you
Take me into your lies
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Lola, Ella]
Swallowed
Under my skin, you crawl
Smile with the pain, take me there (Yeah)
Darkness so bright, take me there (Yeah)
I keep focus on you
I keep my focus on you
Take me into your lies (Sh)

[Verse 2: Satbyeol, Lola]
Nothing else will get my attention (Hey)
Seeing you, I lost to temptation (Hmm)
Yeah, you got me chained by my wings
Got me locked in your touch
And you know I'm addicted
Girls gotta situation
Tied up in a chain and
See the beauty in the pain
Now invite me
Empty out my soul and I wanna be yours
I just want you to control
I don't wanna see you, let me go

[Pre-Chorus: Ella, Satbyeol]
I'm not even afraid to burst into the flames
Hold me tighter than ever before
Let me follow your way
This is what I can take
And I'm getting eaten up
Swallowed
[Chorus: Dia, Sua]
Bewitched
In your hunger, in your hunger (Ooh)
Bewitched
Spreading faster, spreading faster (Ah; Fight me)
There's not another explanation
I keep focus on you
I keep my focus on you
Take me into your lies

[Bridge: Ella, Dajeong, All]
Got us captured in the
Dance of your mysterious fairies
Take us to a different paradise
And fill us with life
Those hands got us stuck
Now we're trapped in your touch
Here we come (Uh)
We're the PIXY

[Chorus: Satbyeol, Ella]
Bewitched
In your hunger, in your hunger
Bewitched
Spreading faster, spreading faster (Ooh)
Let's draw me and you in this night
Come in closer (Come in closer)
Call me over to go inside
[Post-Chorus: Lola, Dia, Ella]
Swallowed (Huh-uh-uh)
Under my skin, you crawl (Uh, uh-ah-ah)
Smile with the pain, take me there (Ah, yeah)
Darkness so bright, take me there (Uh)
I keep focus on you (Uh-uh-uh-uh)
I keep my focus on you
Take me into your liesEmbed
