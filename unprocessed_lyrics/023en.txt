Hoh
Woah-woah, yeah

Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 1: Taeyeon, Tiffany, Seohyun & All]
Dear Santa, could you please lend me your ear?
I got a wish list for you to hear
It hasn't been my kind of year
What about us?
Heartache's been my middle name
I never wanna feel this way again
So I'm asking for a change
What about us?
I think this is gonna be
A Christmas worth remembering
The best you’ll ever see

[Break: Tiffany]
Let's go! Come on, girls!

I'm looking out through the window
Footsteps somewhere in the snow
It is still as fun, just like when I was young
Memories from years ago
This man he won't ever fail me
I know he’s making his round
Reindeers are rushing their way through the night
Santa he won’t let me down

[Pre-Chorus: Taeyeon]
And last night I had trouble sleeping
There’s so much going on in my head
Hearing the sounds through the chimney top
Stayed quiet in my bed

[Chorus: Tiffany, Seohyun]
I always got expectations
I’m hearing sleigh bells right now
They’re under that tree got a present for me
Santa he won’t let me down

[Post-Chorus: Tiffany]
Let’s hear it, Santa!
Here we go! Come on!
[Bridge: Taeyeon, Seohyun]
This man he won’t ever fail me
I know he’s making his round
Reindeers are rushing their way through the night
Santa he won’t let me down

[Pre-Chorus: Tiffany]
And last night I had trouble sleeping
There’s so much going on in my head
Hearing the sounds through the chimney top
Stayed quiet in my bed

[Break: Taeyeon, Seohyun]
Oh... (Oh...)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

[Chorus: Seohyun, Taeyeon]
I always got expectations
I’m hearing sleigh bells right now
I can't believe what I see, no-no
They’re under that tree, got a present for me

[Outro: Tiffany, Taeyeon, Seohyun, All]
Santa he won't let me
Santa he won't let me
Santa he won't let me down!
Santa he won't let me down! (oh, whoa, ooh)
Won't let me down...1Embed
