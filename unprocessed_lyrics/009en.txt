Yeah

[Verse 1: Soyeon]
In the frozen dark of your winter, yeah
The coldest wind cruelly blows
Reaches up to kiss the highest mountain top
Burying my broken heart in snow

[Refrain: Yuqi, Soojin]
Breaking out of here
Get up, build a fire that'll overtake the ice
Gonna wipe it out
Get up, build a fire that is gonna dry the tears I've cried
And out of all the memories we shared
Grows a garden here instead
There wasn't any sun, therе wasn't any moon
But my fire's shining through

[Pre-Chorus: Minnie, Miyeon, Shuhua]
Reddest rеd, all these flowers bloom
When my heart forgets your old distant tune
With my burning flame
I'll ignite the sun just like the spring has come
Flames come alive

HWAA 火 (Burn it up, burn it up)
HWAA 火 (The red flower grows)
HWAA 火 (Burn it up, burn it up)
HWAA 火 (The red flower grows)

[Verse 2: Soyeon, Yuqi]
Yeah, too late to be tellin' me you're sorry
One more ice bullet through my body
Flames searing through what we won't get back
Just like summer buds blooming when winter's season's up
It's coming back around, and I won't let you put me down
See you don't wanna be pushing that card to me
Go tell the ice my spring is coming 'round
I'm starting up my fire, stoking it up high
I'll win back springtime that I lost

[Pre-Chorus: Miyeon, Minnie, Shuhua]
Reddest red all my flowers bloom
When my heart forgets your old wordless tune
And now with my flame
I'll ignite the sun just like the spring has won
Flames come alive

[Chorus: All, Soyeon, Yuqi, Soojin]
HWAA 火 (Burn it up, burn it up)
HWAA 火 (The red flower grows)
HWAA 火 (Burn it up, burn it up)
HWAA 火 (The red flower grows)
[Bridge: Miyeon, Minnie, All, Shuhua]
Higher and higher, the flame of my fire can grow, and grow
Burning and burning, it's finally time to let go, HWAA
HWAA 花
HWAA 花
Flames come alive

[Outro: Soojin]
