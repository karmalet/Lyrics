38 ContributorsI CAN’T STOP ME (English Version) Lyrics[Intro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1: Nayeon & Mina]
I'm hearing all the alarms ring-a-ling
They go off every time that we're face to face
Why is it so hard to resist?
Temptation sweet as honey, I know it's too late

[Pre-Chorus: Sana, Chaeyoung & Jeongyeon]
I feel it deep inside, I'm gonna lose the fight
Eventually I know that I'll be crossing the line
I try warning myself, 'cause I'm in need of help
Can't hold me back, already standing right at the edge
Out of control (Hey)

[Chorus: Jihyo, Momo, Nayeon, Dahyun & (All)]
Oh I've been caught under the spot, spot, spotlight
I wanna cave in to the dark side calling to me
The ending's obvious, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me
(No, woah, woah, hey)
You pull mе over to the red, rеd, red line
I can't escape it, you're my weakness and you're my vice
In the shadows, you're the only highlight
I can't stop me, can't stop me
(No, woah, woah)

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
I can't stop me, can't stop me

[Verse 2: Momo, Dahyun, Jeongyeon, Jihyo, (Chaeyoung)]
You're my forbidden fruit (Ya ya)
Pretend that there's no rules (Ah ah)
I'm turning all the lights off tonight
And spiraling into the abyss, losing myself (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Tzuyu, Sana, Chaeyoung & Jihyo]
There ain't no turning back
Addicted to the feeling like I'm caught in a trance (In a trance)
It's like you flip a switch, your power over me (Hey)
Is limitless and now all I can do is give in
Out of control (Ooh, yeah; Hey)

[Chorus: Nayeon, Dahyun, Jihyo, Mina & (All)]
Oh I've been caught under the spot, spot, spotlight
I wanna cave in to the dark side calling to me (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
The ending's obvious, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me
(No, woah, woah, hey)
You pull me over to the red, red, red line (Red line)
I can't escape it, you're my weakness and you're my vice
In the shadows, you're the only highlight (I can't stop me, yeah)
I can't stop me, can't stop me
(No, woah, woah)
[Verse 3: Chaeyoung, Dahyun & Momo]
Risky, risky, why you test me?
This is an emergency
Help me, help me, somebody stop me
'Cause I know I can't stop me
Getting closer and closer
When I know I'm in danger
Need to get away from ya
You're like the devil on my shoulder

[Bridge: Mina, Sana, Tzuyu & Nayeon]
What's going on inside? (Ah, ah)
There's a war I'm trying to fight (Ooh, ooh)
Since it opened my eyes
I can't stop me, can't stop me, can't stop me (Oh)

[Chorus: Jeongyeon, Chaeyoung, Nayeon, Sana, (All) & (Jihyo)]
Oh I've been caught under the spot, spot, spotlight
I wanna cave in to the dark side calling to me
The ending's obvious, I know it's not right
I can't stop me, can't stop me
(No, woah, woah, hey)
You pull me over to the red, red, red line
I can't escape it, you're my weakness and you're my vice
In the shadows, you're the only highlight (Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I can't stop me, can't stop me (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
(No, woah, woah)
[Post-Chorus: Tzuyu, Nayeon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Ah, ah)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh (Ooh, ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
I can't stop me, can't stop me
No, woah, woah
