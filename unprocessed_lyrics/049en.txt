7 ContributorsNobody (English Version) Lyrics[Intro: Yubin]
You know I still love you, baby
And it will never change
(사랑해)

[Chorus: Sunye & Yeeun, Sunye]
I want nobody, nobody but you
I want nobody, nobody but you
How can I be with another?
I don't want any other
I want nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody

[Verse 1: Sunmi]
Why are you trying to
To make me leave, ya?
I know what you're thinking
Baby, why aren't you listening?
How can I just, just love someone else and
Forgot you completely
When I know you still love me?

[Pre-Chorus: Sohee]
Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know it's not right, so
Just stop and come back, boy
How can this be when we were meant to be?
You might also like[Chorus: Sunye & Yeeun, Yeeun, Sunye]

Nobody, nobody
I want nobody, nobody, but you
I want nobody, nobody, but you
How can I be with another?
I don't want any other
I want nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody

[Verse 2: Sunmi]
Why can't we just, just be like this?
'Cause it's you that I need
And nothing else until the end
Who else can ever make me feel the way
I, I feel when I'm with you
No one will ever do

[Pre-Chorus: Sohee]
Telling me you're not good enough
My life with you is just too tough
You know me enough, so
You know what I need, boy
Right next to you is where I'm meant to be

[Outro: Yubin]
Back to the days when we
Were so young and wild and free
Nothing else mattered other than you and me
So tell me, why can't it be?
Please let me live my life my way
Why do you push me away?
I don't want nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
But you3Embed
