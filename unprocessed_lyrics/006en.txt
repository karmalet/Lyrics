Nothing can pull me away from your embrace
I'm not going anywhere (Where, where)
Here we go again, I hear the sound of pain
Flowing slowly through my veins (Oh god)

[Verse 1: Soyeon]
Help me, help me
Oh, I don't know how to breathe (Don't know how to breathe)
For real (Real)
Set me free, set me free
This craving is gonna be (Almost gonna be)
Deadly

[Pre-Chorus: Yuqi, Miyeon]
I know that you're only playing
I hate it so much, I love it
What would be the repercussions
If I let you inside me?
It's so dangerous, I want it
Guess you got me where you want me
I don't care that I'm addicted

[Chorus: Soyeon, Minnie]
Oh my god (Oh, god)
She took me to the sky (Sky, sky, sky)
Oh my god (Oh, god)
She showed me all the stars (Stars, stars, stars)

Baby, baby
You got me losing my mind (I'm losing my mind)
Tonight (Yeah, yeah)
Toxic, toxic
I tell my friends that I'm fine (I know I'm not fine)
It's a lie

[Verse 3: Soyeon]
Oh god (God), I should stay away
But then you will hit me up and I am on my way (Yeah, yeah)
Can't stop (Stop), girl, you make me sick
But then you make me wanna stick around, I know I got it bad (Woo, uh)
It feels good, yeah, I'll regret it (I'll regret it)
You're detrimental to my health, but I ain't never leavin' (Yeah, yeah, never leavin')
I'm probably crazy, but I need it, want it, gotta have it (Uh, uh)
You may be poison but sure as hell taste like honey

[Pre-Chorus: Miyeon, Yuqi]
Losing all my senses when you pull me close
I don't know how to let go of this passion
So just burn me with your loving
I can't control this desire
We get close, the flames get higher
Nothing can put out this fire
[Chorus: Soojin, Minnie]
Oh my god (Oh, god)
She took me to the sky (Sky, sky, sky)
Oh my god (Oh, god)
She showed me all the stars (Stars, stars, stars)

[Bridge: Shuhua]
Put your hands all over, want your smell on me forever
I'm losing my composure, can't nobody do me better
Time and time again, I told myself I need to let go
Then I fall right back into your arms

[Chorus: Soyeon, Soojin]
Oh my god (Oh, god)
She took me to the sky (Sky, sky, sky)
Oh my god (Oh, god)
She showed me all the stars (Stars, stars, stars)

[Outro: Minnie]
Nothing can pull me away from your embrace
I'm not going anywhere (Where, where)
Here we go again, I hear the sound of pain
Flowing slowly through my veins21Embed
