(I think we could last forever)
(I'm afraid that everything will disappear)
(Just trust me)

[Verse 1]
She's saying, "Baby, come and follow me"
There's not a bad thing here tonight
Save your reasons all for later
Stay with me a little while

[Verse 2]
Watch me go
Now, I sink down, all alone away
Where am I?
A dark haze clouding up my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I can hear the voices listening
Don't know who they are
Trying to take the pressure off
Been reaching for the stars
Tell me, will I find myself again?
When I go too far?
Yeah, I know
You know, I know (Ooh)
You might also like[Chorus]
I'd rather be
Lost in the lights, lost in the lights
I'm outta my mind
Can you help me numb the pain?
Each night, you spin me up high
Emotions on ice
Let me have a taste

[Post-Chorus]
Give me a good ride (Oh, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Oh, it's gon' be a good night (Oh, I'm fallin')
Forever, you and I

[Interlude]
Mmm-hmm
Yeah, hey
Mmm-hmm
Ooh-woah
Mmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm
(Forever, you and I)

[Verse 3]
All my reflections, I
Can't even recognize
I'm feelin' so alive, wasting time
[Chorus]
I'd rather be
Lost in the lights
Lost in the lights
I'm outta my mind
Can you help me numb the pain?
Each night
You spin me up high
Emotions on ice
Let me have a taste

[Post-Chorus]
Give me a good ride (Oh, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
It's gon' be a good night (Oh, I'm fallin')
Forever, you and I

[Outro]
This will break me
This is gonna break me (Break me)
No, don't you wake me (Wake me)
I wanna stay in this dream, don't save me
Don't you try to save me (Save me)
I need a way we (Way we)
I need a way we can dream on (On, on, on)
(Alone again)
(What's the point?)4Embed
