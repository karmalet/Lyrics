Of past civilizations, of continents gone adrift
Talk to me about love, tell me more about human love
Of anomalous travellers in magical, mystic territories, ahead

We followed by instinct only the comets trail
As vanguards of another system in search of the end

No time, no space
Another race of vibrations
The sea of the simulation
Keep your feelings in memory
I love you, especially tonight

The air-traffic controllers just ready for take-off
Astrological telescopes to discover new stars
The air-traffic controllers just ready for take-off
(Walking Sundays, walking Sundays)
Astrological telescopes to discover new stars (As a spacer, as a spacer) ahead

We followed by instinct only the comets trail
As vanguards of another system in search of the end

No time, no space
Another race of vibrations
The sea of the simulation
Keep your feelings in memory
I love you, especially tonight

Another race of vibrations

Keep your feelings in memory
I love you, especially tonightEmbed
