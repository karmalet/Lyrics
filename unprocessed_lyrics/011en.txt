8 ContributorsTake Me Home (English Version) Lyrics[Intro: San]
Ooh yeah, yeah
Ah (Hey!)

[Verse 1: San, Yunho, Wooyoung, Yeosang]
Locked inside the dark
Where I'm suffocating deeper
I'm just falling down
Deeper, I'm falling down
Blocked in every way
I can't even choose my way
Around I'm terrified
I'm getting terrified
No one here, no one, not anyone
Nobody cares about me
That cold look you give, that gaze you give
Make tears in my eyes

[Pre-Chorus: Mingi]
Yeah-eh
아름다울수록 가시가 박혀 쓰려와
망가지는 걸 알면서도 난 또 기로 앞에
눈물 닦아 사방이 검붉기에
왼쪽 가슴에 신념을 달고 날아

[Chorus: Seonghwa, Jongho]
Somebody, take me home (Hey!)
I don't wanna be alone anymore
Every night
That place of my dreams
Somebody, take me there
Getting out of the gray city
Following the light
To that place in our memory

[Verse 2: Hongjoong]
누군가는 날 가두고
또 누군가는 날 구조해
그 누군가가 날 등지면
누군가는 날 위로해
Alone, alone, alone, I'm not alone
외딴 섬이라도 무인도는 아니니깐 alive, yeah

[Refrain: Yunho, San, Yeosang, Jongho]
Why always me? What I do wrong?
What am I in the rain for, in the rain for?
Rain in my tears, pouring in my eyes
Is it something that you sent to me? Oh no
Oh, gonna get out of here
Oh, go back to my dreams right now
So tell me how to go to other side

[Chorus: Seonghwa, Jongho]
Somebody, take me home (Hey!)
I don't wanna be alone anymore
Every night
That place of my dreams
Somebody, take me there
Getting out of the gray city
Following the light
To that place in our memory
[Bridge A: Wooyoung, Seonghwa, San, Yeosang]
Under the red sun I stand
Let's hold hands 'til the sun falls down
With warm eyes I wanna melt your soul
If we share our dreams
You can feel the vibe, and just smile away
Go back to the place in time

[Bridge B: Jongho, Seonghwa, Hongjoong, Mingi]
People cannot live alone
Don't leave me now (Don't leave me now)
Don't leave me now, oh (Don't leave me now)
Oh, take me home
Take me, please, out of the dark
Take me, please, out of the calm (Woah-oh-oh)
고통을 받을 자격 나조차도 없어
돌려줄게 받고 사라져줘 take me now

[Chorus: Seonghwa, Jongho, San]
Somebody, take me home (Hey!)
I don't wanna be alone anymore
Every night (Every night)
That place of my dreams
Somebody, take me there (Take me there)
Getting out of the gray city
Following the light
To that place in our memory6Embed
