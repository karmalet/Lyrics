I got a lot of requests to do an English cover of this song, but I was nervous 'cause it's completely different than my usual stuff. It took a while, but in the end I couldn't resist... 'CAUSE THIS IS THE GREATEST BIGBANG SONG OF ALL TIME.

I asked my BREDRINS to help me out on this one. For those who don't know, "KMESS" is an unofficial band we started in high school consisting of Sean, Brian, Don, Sonny, Josh, and me :D Sonny's in university out of town and Brian couldn't make it for obvious reasons (lol). But I asked my little bro Eddie to jump in! I think they killed it :)

Anyway, ENJOY! And please share it with your friends if you dig it!!
Much love
