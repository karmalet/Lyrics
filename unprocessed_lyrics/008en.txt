[Verse 1: Mark]
Roll on in tonight, do it right, do it how you want
Long night, daylight, stay here till the-till the sun
I'm about to throw my hands up in the air
Get that everywhere, give it up
Flip it back like we don't care

[Pre-Chorus: Taeyong]
If you wanna roll inside with our clique
Then lay your pretty hand in my hand
Give it, give it a kiss, uh huh-huh
All we do is party, it ain't something to miss
That's why all the world be spinning 'round a-all of it, aha

[Bridge: Jaehyun, Doyoung, Taeil, (Doyoung & Taeil), Mark]
Where will it end? I don't know
But I can tell you where it's 'bout to go (Yeah, yeah)
Just getting started, this ain't half of it
They done messed around, let us get in, it's over
Going up and the sky's the limit
We about to set it all on fire
(With this one single flame I'm changing this game)
I'm the biggest hit, I'm the biggest hit
[Verse 3: Mark]
Uh, hard rock, scalp, head shot, pop, no talk
All the guys singing this song wasting time fittin' into your box
Ayy, okay, okay, spilling it out like chardonnay
Right hand to God, we gonna get it, ain't no other way
Pulling it off, I pray so my people keep, keep watching me now
Who cares about a hater, hater talk, talk
I hear what you sayin' but so what?
Won't say it to my face so I'm off, like a gunshot
You'll love it, put me on, now we gone, cherry bomb
