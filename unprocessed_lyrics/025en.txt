3 ContributorsWonderland (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
Can you imagine walking on purple skies
Sitting on the clouds up high? Oh na-na-na
Oh when it happens, you're in your paradise
The darkness in your night, you'll see the light

[Pre-Chorus]
You're like a shooting star, day dream
Cotton candy, you're my fantasy
It's magical, I'm feeling so oh
You give me butterflies, I wanna fly
There's nothing like you that I ever tried
It's magical, I'm feeling so oh

[Chorus]
This is my kinda wonderland
This is my kinda wonderland
This is more than a dream, a perfect melody
Like a song I can sing
It's my kinda wonderland

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
My kinda wonderland

If you imagine the rainbow
Where trees are walking, the flowers are talking
Oh maybe baby (Oh maybe baby)
We just might make this come true
A world with just me and you, you...

[Pre-Chorus]
You're like a shooting star, day dream
Cotton candy, you're my fantasy
It's magical, I'm feeling so oh
You give me butterflies, I wanna fly
There's nothing like you that I ever tried
It's magical, I'm feeling so oh

[Chorus]
This is my kinda wonderland
This is my kinda wonderland
This is more than a dream, a perfect melody
Like a song I can sing
It's my kinda wonderland

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh
My kinda wonderland
[Bridge]
The place that we dream of
Is right before our eyes, oh, ooh...
Embracing the moment
Feeling this magic
Baby only with, oh you!

[Chorus]
This is my kinda wonderland
This is my kinda wonderland
This is more than a dream, a perfect melody (More than a dream, perfect melody)
Like a song I can sing (Ooh)
It's my kinda wonderland

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh (You, woah)
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh (No-oh, ooh)
My kinda wonderland
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh (No, woah)
Woah-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh-oh (Hey)
My kinda wonderland1Embed
