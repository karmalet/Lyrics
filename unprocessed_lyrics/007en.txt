32 ContributorsCat & Dog (English Version) Lyrics[Intro: Huening Kai, Soobin]
Turn me from a cat into a dog
Now, I want you to take me on a walk
Watch me be the loyalest of all
Okay, baby, here's the leash (Purr purr purr)

[Chorus: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]
I don’t wanna be just friends
It's no coincidence, it's a kitty-incidence
They be testing out your patience, but I’m here for it
Girl, I promise (Girl, I promise)
So get used to it, ain't no stopping
Me when you walk in
Got me acting up all crazy, lemme be your pet
Baby make a lil' room, let me get next to ya
I was messin' (I was messin')
Now I'm thankin' ya
I learned my lesson (Purr purr)

[Verse 1: Huening Kai, Beomgyu, Soobin]
Baby, baby, you give me a halo (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I was far from cute before
Now I'm an angel (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
So make room for me
I hope you don’t let go (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
’Cause I've been such a good boy
I hope you don’t say no (Meow!)
(But) Oh my God, what is this new emotion? (You)
Now, I'm such a puppy when you hold me (You)
Feed me love, it's perfect and you know it
Follow you in circles and no, that is not a joke, babe

[Verse 2: Yeonjun]
I'm the one you can't keep your, keep your paws off (Hey)
Go fetch when you say that I'm a dog walk (Hey)
Fight for you in the biggest pack of wolves
They be racing, but I'm comin' in first (Woof woof) Impala
(Come to me) Yeah, I like it when we cuddle
(Come to me) When you get yourself in trouble
I'm everything (Shoo)
From the soft side to the tough stuff
'Til we cross the rainbow bridge
I'll be the one you always dream of
[Bridge: Taehyun, Soobin]
(Oh-oh-oh-oh) Bet nobody else speaks
The lil' language between you and me
(Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I just hope you understand (Purr, purr, purr)

[Chorus: Beomgyu, Taehyun]
I don't wanna be just friends
It's no coincidence, it's a kitty-incidence

I learned my lesson (Purr purr)
