3 ContributorsStop Girl [English Version] Lyrics[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1: Hoon, Kiseop, Eli]
Oh so we came a long way
From the darkest night
Still I don't want to fight you no more
I'm so tired
Oh so we came a long way
And I hate to see you cry
As they days fly by and the tears in your eyes telling me goodbye

[Pre-Chorus Dongho, Soohyun]
Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days I can't take the lying
Today's the day that I'll be flying away, yeah
I gave you all that you needed
So why do I feel defeated?
And now my heart is depleted
'Can't find my way-eh-eh
You might also like[Chorus: All,Kevin]
Stop girl in the name of love
Stop girl in the name of love (Eh, eh)
Stop girl in the name of love
And just like a dream I know your love isn't real

[Interlude]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 2: Eli, Kiseop, Hoon]
I got you cornered girl, where you gonna go?
Up against the wall like an animal
Breathe deep, show your teeth underneath the lies I know your love could be one of a kind, girl
And I know that karma's coming back for you
Baby, this is just a game for two
You know better now, now

[Pre-Chorus: Kevin, Soohyun]
Some days I don't feel like trying
Some days I can't take the lying
Today's the day that I'll be flying away
I gave you all that you needed
So why do I feel defeated?
And now my heart is depleted
Can't find my way-eh-eh
[Chorus: All,Soohyun]
Stop girl in the name of love
Stop girl in the name of love (Eh, eh)
Stop girl in the name of love
And just like a dream I know your love isn't real

[Verse 3: Eli]
Don't wanna push you away again
No choice even though you're my only friend
Someone told me that you're lying to me again
Like a note that you always forget to send
Seal me up then send me away
Maybe we can try again another day
Till then the only words that I gotta say
You're trippin' girl
Get up and get out of my way

[Chorus: All,Kevin,Dongho]
Stop girl in the name of love
(Baby, don't you care about the way you're making me feel?)
Stop girl in the name of love
Stop girl in the name of love
And just like a dream I know your love isn't real

[Bridge: Kevin, Soohyun]
You're saying that you're busy
But your time is up
Don't ever try to call me
'Cause I won't pick up
(I won't pick up the phone)
You're saying that you're busy
(Baby, i'm not home)
But your time is up
Don't every try to call me
'Cause I won't pick up
[Outro: All]
Stop girl in the name of loveEmbed
