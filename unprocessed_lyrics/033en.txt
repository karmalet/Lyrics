3 Contributors거짓말처럼 (Just As a Lie) [English Version] LyricsI don't know what I have to say
I thought I knew all of you now I've got
Nothing of you
I know that you already know about this

You don't wanna talk about
Reaching the end of the line that we found
And you put on your smile
So did you know what I've been waiting for?
Is my heart getting faded out?
I could only let myself down

You still hold me
You hold me like you always did
As if you've known all
This in your embracing arms

When you hold me
I still remember of that night
The night we seized the light
That looked so bright and fine

But I just cannot deny that we should stop
Could it be right

Walking through the time we've passed
I could not find anything wrong in you
Stay on your way
But I've been waiting for you used to be
So hold me tight before I leave
I could only let myself down
You might also likeYou still hold me
You hold me like you always did
As if you've known all
This in your embracing arms

When you hold me
I still remember of that night
The night we seized the light
That looked so bright and fine

But I just cannot deny that we should stop
Could it be right

Sometimes I feel
You in my dreams I want to close my eyes
Where could it be
The memories call me and fade away

You still hold me
You hold me like you always did
As if you've known all
This in your embracing arms
When you hold me
I do remember of that night
The night we seized the light that
Looked so bright and fine
But I just cannot deny that we should stop
I do love you but I doubt
Could it be rightEmbed
