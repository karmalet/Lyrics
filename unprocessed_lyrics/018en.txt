25 ContributorsMORE & MORE (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1: Nayeon, Mina]
I know I want it
I don't wanna hide, pretending I don't want it
'Cause I deserve it (Deserve it)
I'm not worried
What you'll think of me when you see what's inside me
'Cause I know you (I know you)

[Refrain: Tzuyu, Momo]
Don't look away, look in my eyes (Hey)
Show me your heart, do not disguise (Hey)
You can run, but you cannot hide, no, no
Even if you tell me goodbye (Hey)
Whenever you open your eyes (Hey)
You'll think of me, you're hypnotized (Yeah, yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Sana, Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Jihyo, (Jeongyeon), (Nayeon)]
You're gonna say more, more, more, more, more and more
Can't help but say more, more, more, and more
'Cause you can’t get enough
I wanna have more, more, more, more, more and more
(And you will say more, more, more, and more)
('Cause it's never enough) More

[Chorus: Dahyun, Tzuyu, Mina, Momo, (All)]
You'll be begging for more
(More and more)
'Cause you can't get enough, -nough
You'll be craving for more
(More and more)
'Cause it's never enough

Do you feel me?
Or do you still not understand how much you love me?
Boy, you need me, you want me
Stop pretending
I can see it in your eyes, you're already mine
'Cause I know you, I know you

[Refrain: Sana, Jihyo]
Even if you cover your ears (Ah)
Push me away for years and years (Ah)
In your heart, I won't disappear (Be right there), no, no
If I ever call out your name (Ah)
Your heart will feel just like the same (Ah)
You are gonna be mine again
And once again!

[Bridge: Dahyun, Chaeyoung, Nayeon]
I'm a greedy girl, sorry if you didn't know
Take my apology because I want you more and more
Gonna steal your heart, own it and won't let it go
By then you'll understand you can't say no, no
I'll be sneaking in your heart like a stray cat
Conquer it and put my mark on it like a tat
My love, so sweet the plan will never fall flat
And once again! (More)

You'll be craving for more (More and more)
(More and more)
'Cause it’s never enough (More)6Embed
