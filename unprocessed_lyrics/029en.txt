7 ContributorsThumbs Up (English Version) Lyrics[Intro: Hyebin]
I'm sick and tired of checking my feed
Counting 'like' is meaningless
My phone keeps ringing, won't stop ringing
All day, all night goes beep beep beep beep

[Verse 1: Nancy, Nayun]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh, who's the hot, hot issue, issue?
Eno-o-ugh from this no good issue, issue
Just another day, day
I don't want that blah blah blah
But I'm okay, I'm okay
I got used to it

[Pre-Chorus: Ahin, Jane, JooE]
Now I just wanna fall in love, yeah in love
Running away from all of those eyes
So who wish to fill my heart? Tell me now
But everyday, I feel like a queen

[Chorus: All, JooE]
Thumbs up!
Thumbs up!
Thumbs up!
From head to toe, head to toe
Can't get enough of me?
You might also like[Post-Chorus: All, Nancy]
Thumbs up!
Lalalalalalala
T-t-t, thumbs up!
Lalalalalalala
Just can't get enough of me
T-t-t-thumbs up!

[Verse 2: JooE, Ahin]
The blue badge on my account (Aye!)
I have too many followers (Followers)
Feel like I'm the precious one
We've never met before, so I need (Wow!)
Somebody who knows me well

[Verse 3: Jane, Nayun]
All eyes on me, I'm the hot, hot issue, issue
A-all I hear is just 'I-I miss you, miss you'
Just another day, day
I don't want that blah blah blah
But I'm okay, I'm okay
I got used to it

[Pre-Chorus: Ahin, Jane, JooE]
Now I just wanna fall in love, yeah in love
Running away from all of those eyes
So who wish to fill my heart? Tell me now
But everyday, I feel like a queen
[Chorus: All, JooE]
Thumbs up!
Thumbs up!
Thumbs up!
From head to toe, head to toe
Can't get enough of me?

[Post-Chorus: All, Nancy]
Thumbs up!

Lalalalalalala
Just can't get enough of me
T-t-t-thumbs up!

[Bridge: Nancy, Nayun, Jane]
Ooh, lalala, lalala spotlight
Shining life and the light toward me (Shine)
Ooh, lalala, li-li-like me more
Just keep your eyes on me!

[Chorus: All, Hyebin, JooE]
Thumbs up!
Like it more and more, more and more
Thumbs up!
Be like whatever, whatever
Thumbs up!
I'm your only one, only one
From head to toe, head to toe
Can't get enough of me?
[Post-Chorus: All, Nancy]

Just can't get enough of me
