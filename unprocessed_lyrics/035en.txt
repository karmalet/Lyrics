4 ContributorsID; Peace B (English Version) Lyrics[Verse 1]
It's the way you see me
But it's not what I am leave your worries behind
Now you're gonna hear what I say
Please don't try to stop me
Now it's time for me to do things on my own
Let me do it my way!

[Pre-Chorus]
All I ever do is listen to you
Saying that I'm just a problem
But now I know what I should do

[Chorus]
We play together as one
Peace B is my network ID
Now I know for sure, I can make my choices on my own
Log in together as one;
Connecting to my neverland
Chuka, Chuka, Chu!
Getting closer in the name of peace!

[Verse 2]
It's the way you judge me
Thinking what you see is what I am inside
Just because you think you know me
Don't know my expressions
Never try to understand my way of life
Acting like you know me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Even though I am younger
I still know the way to keep it stronger
That's why weren't ready for me

[Chorus]
We play together as one
Peace B is my network ID
Now I know for sure, I can make my choices on my own
Log in together as one;
Connecting to my Neverland
Chuka, Chuka, Chu!
Getting closer in the name of peace!

[Bridge]
You may think I'm young
I know you think you know what's better
You always think you know, times have changed that was long ago
Now it's time for me to do what's best for me
I know that I will fly high
