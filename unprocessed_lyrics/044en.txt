And as usual...
This is not a literal word for word translation, but an english version and adaption of the song. I always try to be as true as possible to the original lyrics.

 ► LYRICS

I really want you
Take all that I have
Cause I want your love, love
I really want you
I’m leaving myself tonight
I want you love, love
I really want you

My blood, sweat, tears they flow
Through heart, body and soulI am yours do you know how I miss you?You’re a curse and I’m cursed to my doom 

Peaches and cream
Sweeter than sweet
Chocolate cheeks
And chocolate wings
But what you got are wings that are cut
All that is sweet’s tasting bitter, bitter

Kiss me hard, it’s okay
You need to tighten me up
So I can’t feel how bad you hurt me
Baby, poison my brain, of you I’m getting drunk
Stay with me, my whiskey

I really want you
Take all that I have
Cause I want your love, love
I really want you
I’m leaving myself tonight
I want you love, love

That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it
That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it

Pain is okay, just tie me up
Real hard so I can’t runaway
Hold me tonight and shake me up
So I can’t figure out what is real

Kiss me on the lips, lips
You are my secret
I’m done, prisoned by your love, addicted
I don’t want anything but you, not
I drank the Holy Grail that is so poisonous, yeah

I really want you
Take all that I have
Cause I want your love, love
I really want you
I’m leaving myself tonight
I want you love, love

That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it
That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
That’s how much I want it, want it, want it
Want it, want it

Kill me softly cause I want you to
Close my eyes this time, I want you to
Cause I can’t resist whatever you do
I can’t runaway from you anymore
You’re too sweet I want you here
Want you here with me
Want you here, don’t let go

I really want you (la la la la la)
I really want you (la la la la la)
