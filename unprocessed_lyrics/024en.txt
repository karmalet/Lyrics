4 ContributorsFly (English Version) Lyrics[Intro: Fabolous]
(I won't lose) Fabulous
(Somebody tell 'em I won't lose) Low so
(I won't lose) The young O.G
(Somebody tell 'em I won't lose)

[Verse 1: Jessica]
Invisible, push through the fog
I have to find my way, yeah
A glow of light, a spark of hope
If you imagine it, you'll find

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica]
You're reaching for all things to follow your dreams
And nothing will stand in your way
You're not far, you're close, so stand up for yourself
It's written in the sky

[Chorus: Jessica]
Just spread your wings, reach for your dreams
There's no mountain that's hard to move (There's no mountain that's hard to move)
Take a chance and try, you would never know
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly

[Post-Chorus: Jessica]
Woah, oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
You're a hero, you can fly
Woah, oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
You can fly

Unthinkable, best is to come
The light is shining so bright now
No looking back, keep pressing up (Hold on)
'Cause your wings are made to fly

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica]
You're reaching for all things to follow your dreams
And nothing will stand in your way
You're not far, you're close, so stand up for yourself
It's written in the sky

[Chorus: Jessica]
Just spread your wings, reach for your dreams
There's no mountain that's hard to move (There's no mountain that's hard to move) (Ooh)

[Bridge: Jessica]
I don't plan on breaking down
I don't plan on falling down
I won't lose
I won't lose
Oh no, no, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Fabolous, Jessica]
Yeah, let's go Jess
You should've never doubted yourself
Matter of fact: You should be proud of yourself
'Cause you had to find a way, go about it yourself
Nobody gave you direction, had to route it yourself
And you never got lost; losing's not an option
No time for L's, no time to fail
Winning like Steph Curry and them we Warriors
Haters wanna see me in a Crown Victoria
But I'm in a Benz, AC on 70
Won't lose my cool, gotta move cleverly
Chess, not checkers, playing it with strategy (No, no)
Me and Jessica, that's a win automatically (No, no, no, no)

[Chorus: Jessica]
Just spread your wings, reach for your dreams ('Cause I won't lose!)
There's no mountain that's hard to move (There's no mountain that's hard to move) (Ooh)
Take a chance and try, you would never know (Oh ooh)
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly
[Post-Chorus: Jessica]
Woah, oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
You're a hero, you can fly
Woah, oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh (Ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
Oh, woah, oh woah-oh-oh
You can flyEmbed
