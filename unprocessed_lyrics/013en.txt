2 ContributorsHUG -International ver.- LyricsJust for one day I would like to be
The bed in your room, oh baby
I want to hold you
In my chest more warmly

I want to know you a little more
Through your smallest whispers
I would even win against
The monsters in your dreams

For days of my life you aren't in
How do I pass them by?
I am so curious
Of how much you love me

I want to become a page
In the diary in your small drawer
To fill my feelings with
Your unknown secrets

Just for one day
I would like to be your kitten, oh baby
While staying in your soft bosom
Enjoying the delicious milk you give

While I move around playing
I must have unknowingly felt
Jealousy inside your cute kisses
You might also likeMy feelings are like this
Something you cannot see on the outside
No matter who I look at or where I am
You are the only one I see

Just for one day
I want to be your close lover
I would hear all your
Boastings and complaints for you

In my heart, in my soul
Although this love is still a bit clumsy
It is everything in the world
I want to give it to you, even if in my dreams

My feelings are like this
And even if I can only watch
I am so thankful, I am very happy
Even if I come short a bit

Until whenever by your side
I want to be stay your lover
I want to freeze in time
With you held against my chest foreverEmbed
