Original music by f(x) (SME)
Instrumental/remix by DJ Burningjay
Lyrics/vocals by me
Video content does not belong to me

I love this song so much, and I've always been interested in writing an English version, so when the opportunity to collaborate came up, I jumped on it :)

I was somewhat surprised to see that the original lyrics to this song make absolutely no sense, so I made up my own angle. If you've ever seen the movie Mean Girls, this is stuff that Regina George would say to anybody who isn't her. LOL.

Hey, yo
Say you wanna try me
It's not a simple thing
You think you wanna be me
You don't stand a chance
Change everything about you
Still would not succeed
Nothing but a copy
Wouldn't you agree?

Don't hold a candle to me
Everything is mine perfectly
You bring nothing but shame and pity
Hands off my NU ABO

Mystery, mystery
Hold up hold up, just a minute, hold up
You better stop this little game
Cuz you and I are not the same
Hysteric, hysteric
Because because laughing at you because
Your wish is to become my clone
You'll never reach NU ABO

Na na na...NU ABO

Would you threaten to defy me?
I'm in the trance
Even if you had the mojo
I'd knock you flat
In this world your life is tiny
I am the queen
Your existence has no meaning
You should just begone 

Your style is embarrassing
Not to mention really ugly
Like a pile of unwanted laundry
You're just a good-for-nothing

Mystery, mystery
Hold up hold up, just a minute, hold up
You better stop this little game
Cuz you and I are not the same
Hysteric, hysteric
Because because laughing at you because
Your wish is to become my clone
You'll never reach NU ABO

Na na na...NU ABO

Stop dreaming, believing, that you could be me someday
Delusions are forming in that ever-empty head of yours, yeah
I'm first class, you're low grade
Bet you'll never get as high as me
Mystery ABO will you ever let this one go
Gotta let it go, oh

What you what you call
What you what you what you call

Yes this is how we do it our love effects
Yeah, yeah, yeah this is how we do it pure love effects
Yeah, yeah, yeah this is how we do it brand new love effects

You're a moldy wasteland rotting in the garbage can
How can you bear being disgusting? Don't understand

Mystery, mystery
Hold up hold up, just a minute, hold up
You better stop this little game
Cuz you and I are not the same
Hysteric, hysteric
Because because laughing at you because
Your wish is to become my clone
You'll never reach NU ABO

Na na na...NU ABO
Yeah, yeah, yeah this is how we do it pure love effects
Yeah, yeah, yeah this is how we do it brand new NU ABO
