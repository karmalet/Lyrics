And as usual...
This is not a literal word for word translation, but an english version and adaption of the song. I always try to be as true as possible to the original lyrics.

► LYRICS

Fall (everything)
Fall (everything)
Fall (everything)
You’re hurting me
Fall (everything)
Fall (everything)
Fall (everything)
Stop hurting me

Don't even wanna have to think of you
You keep invading, I don't want you to
My head explodes, I overload  
Don’t say you’re sorry ’cause I’m over you

Stop this love ’cause you don’t want me, oh
The things you say and do destroy me, oh
You broke my heart in two, you let go
I can’t move, you cut through, I hate you
Take it all away, go back, don’t wanna see you

But you’re my everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Everything (You’re my)
Don’t wanna see you, huh
Stay with me (I hate u)
Can you please (I hate u)
Forgive me (shit)

I need you girl
Why am I thinking of you? Loving you when you don’t care
I need you girl
Why do I need your comfort? When I know you’re hurting me
I need you girl, you’re all that I want
I need you girl, but I can’t go on
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl, I need you girl (leggo)

It goes round and round, why do you keep on hurting me?
I go down and down, I’m just a fool but I wanna be
I know nothing can help me, no, my heart is beyond control
I can’t help but falling down, yeah
Baby, I can’t listen, I try but I can’t so,
I’m talking to myself (talking to myself)
I’m talking to myself (talking to myself)
I don’t know what to do ’cause you won’t ever look at me
Still, the sky is blue again (still, the sky is blue again)

The sky is beautiful, the sun shines over you
My tears are pouring down under the sky
Why are you leaving me when you're the one I need
Why did you have to be the one for me

I need you girl
Why am I thinking of you? Loving you when you don’t care
I need you girl
Why do I need your comfort? When I know you’re hurting me
I need you girl, you’re all that I want
I need you girl, but I can’t go on
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl, I need you girl

Girl, do you need, do you need this to end now? just say so
Girl, could it be, could it be that you’re telling me to go?
Tell me ’cause I don’t wanna hurt you
Tell me what to do, if you want to
Leave me so that I can let you go, oh

I need you girl (yeah, oh baby)
Why am I thinking of you? Loving you when you don’t care
I need you girl (why?)
Why do I need your comfort? When I know you’re hurting me (when I know you’re hurting me)
I need you girl, you’re all that I want
I need you girl, but I can’t go on
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl, I need you girl (leggo)
