9 ContributorsWhat Do I Do (English Version) Lyrics[Intro]
Hey, no
Oh, ooh

[Verse 1]
I'm looking for the reason, baby
Why you might second-guess me
We seemed so perfectly aligned and ready
Forever meant together with you
I never pictured myself with nobody else
With nobody else

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Never thought that you would change
'Cause I'm here, still the same

[Chorus]
Don't know what to do, baby
'Cause I'm not over you
What do I do, baby?
You're still the one
And I can't seem to move on
From the thought of being apart
I'm sitting here alone and lost and confused
So what do I do?
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now this can't be the end, no
I know you can't be serious
I'll ask you once more for the sake of you and me
So search a little deeper, baby
You gotta remember all of the things we shared
All the things we felt

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I need you to explain
Why your heart had to change

[Chorus]
Don't know what to do, baby
'Cause I'm not over you
What do I do, baby?
You're still the one
And I can't seem to move on
From the thought of being apart
I'm sitting here alone and lost and confused

[Interlude]
What do I do? No...
(Can't be without you)

[Bridge]
Don't know what to do, baby
I'm so lost in you, baby
I need you right next to me, yeah!
[Chorus]
Don't know what to do, baby (Don't know what to do)
'Cause I'm not over you (I'm not over you, baby)
What do I do, baby?
You're still the one
And I can't seem to move on (Ooh)
From the thought of being apart
I'm sitting here alone and lost and confused

[Post-Chorus]
Don't know what to do, baby
I'm so lost in you, baby
I need you right next to me
Don't know what to do, baby
I'm so lost in you, baby
I need you right next to me

[Outro]
So what do I do?
Tell me, what do I do?1Embed
